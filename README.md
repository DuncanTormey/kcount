# kcount
Python command line tool to count kmers
I wrote this tool to count kmers present in a fastq files. I would suggest that anyone serious about doing this, instead use a tool like JellyFish (https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish). This was mostly a cool way for me to learn how to use generators.
